/**
 * Addressing the app when it is a FILE, not a site (spec 027 D42).
 *
 * The extension packages the same prerendered pages the site serves, so a route
 * lives at a path plus `.html`: `/en/wallet` is the file `/en/wallet.html`, and
 * `/en` is `/en.html`. On the web the two are the same thing because a server
 * maps one to the other. Under `chrome-extension://` nothing does — measured:
 * an extension URL resolves neither a directory index (`/en/` and `/en` both
 * come back `ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND`) nor an extensionless twin, and a twin cannot
 * even be written where SvelteKit has already made a directory for the route's
 * data.
 *
 * That is harmless for CLIENT navigation, which never asks for a document. It
 * is fatal for anything that leaves the page: a full navigation to `/en/wallet`
 * lands on `chrome-error://chromewebdata/`, and so does a reload after any
 * client navigation.
 *
 * So the app keeps its route paths everywhere and translates them at exactly
 * the two moments a document is actually fetched — a deliberate full
 * navigation, and the address bar after a client one.
 *
 * On the hosted site every function here is the identity function, decided by
 * the page's own origin. There is no build flag: the same bundle is correct in
 * both places.
