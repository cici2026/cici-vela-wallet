/**
 * The only place the `fee_policy` core touches the outside world.
 *
 * Six operations, six existing service calls. No branching on business
 * meaning: every rule that used to live in `GasFeeCard`, `useSendController`
 * and `estimateTransactionFee` — the bundler-quote acceptance, the gas-price
 * fallback, the ×1.5 padding, the 1 KiB calldata cliff, the in-band pricing,
 * the balance<fee gate — is in `rust/crates/vela-core/src/app/fee_policy.rs`.
 * If this file ever grows an `if` that decides what a fee IS, that decision
 * belongs in the machine.
 *
 * The readers deliberately stop at the wire (`fetchRawGasSignals`,
 * `fetchRawBundlerQuote` in `safe-transaction.ts`) rather than reusing
 * `getGasPrices` / `getBundlerGasQuote`: those two already apply the rules the
 * core also holds, and feeding the core their output would apply each rule
 * twice with neither side owning it.
 *
 * Failure contract (shared effect loop): nothing rejects. Every rejection is
 * converted by `feeOperationFailure` into the result variant that operation
 * answers with, so classification stays in the core.
