// Ported from src/services/wallet-state-core/batch-import-types.ts @ f9bcb278 — RN seams rewritten to the web modules; logic verbatim.
/**
 * Platform-neutral types for the `batch_import` core (spec 017, group G5).
 *
 * Separate from `batch-import-executor.web.ts` for the same reason
 * `types.ts` is separate from `executors.web.ts`: the native stub
 * (`batch-import-session.ts`) needs these declarations, and importing them
 * from a `.web` module would drag the web-only service graph (file pickers,
 * SheetJS) into the native bundle — where the wasm cannot load at all.
