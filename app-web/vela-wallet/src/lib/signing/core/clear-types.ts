/**
 * Platform-neutral types and the locale codec for the `clear_signing` core

 *
 * Ported from src/services/wallet-state-core/clear-types.ts @ f9bcb278, minus
 * its RESULT codec. That codec existed to translate the core's fields back
 * into the shapes Expo's own 1,321-line TypeScript twin declared; on the web
 * that twin is not ported (Rust owns the ladder), so `signing/live.ts` reads
 * the generated view directly. One shape, not two that can drift.
 *
 * What remains is the locale preset: the core owns WHICH number is shown, the
 * preset says how digits group, and `auto` is resolved here because detecting
 * it reads `Intl` — a shell capability.
