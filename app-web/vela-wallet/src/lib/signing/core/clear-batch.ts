// Ported from src/services/wallet-state-core/clear-batch.ts @ f9bcb278 — RN seams rewritten to the web modules; logic verbatim.
/**
 * The signing sheet's EIP-5792 batch derivations — pure, platform-neutral, and
 * deliberately free of React so they can be tested without rendering.
 *
 * Two jobs, both of which used to be ad-hoc state inside `SigningSheet.tsx`:
 *
 * 1. **"is the per-leg descriptor pass still running?"** — expressed as a
 *    comparison between the pass's INPUT and the pass's stored OUTPUT rather
 *    than as a boolean flag. A boolean needs a reset, a reset needs a place to
 *    live, and the place it lived (a cancellable `.finally`) could be skipped —
 *    which latched the sheet into a permanent loading state that the user could
 *    only escape by closing the sheet, i.e. by rejecting a request they never
 *    saw. `pending` here is a function of two values that are both present on
 *    every render, so there is nothing to leave un-reset.
 *
 * 2. **"is this token symbol showable?"** — both approval-guard controllers
 *    hand back a placeholder symbol while the metadata read is in flight AND
 *    when it failed outright, so the placeholder is a spinner, not a symbol,
 *    and a compact row must not print it as one.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * OWNERSHIP (re-affirmed): these belong to the SHELL, and the reason is
 * structural, not a preference.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * `clear_signing` resolves ONE transaction at a time and supersedes anything
 * in flight the moment a new `ResolveTransaction` arrives (`Event::` doc,
 * `attempt` in the model). An EIP-5792 bundle is therefore not one core
 * question but N of them: `SigningSheet.tsx` opens a separate core session per
 * leg precisely because one session cannot hold N concurrent resolutions —
 * and single-session supersession is the wrong shape for the question being
 * asked here, which is *"do these N answers, together, belong to the request
 * currently on screen?"*. No core is in a position to know that; the shell
 * that fanned the legs out is. So the pass is tagged with the key of the input
 * it answers, and the sheet compares keys.
 *
 * That is also the *reason* this file exists rather than a boolean: the
 * comparison is a total function of two values present on every render, so
 * unlike a `resolving` flag it cannot latch. A latched flag here disabled
 * Confirm permanently with the loading placeholder up, leaving "close the
 * sheet" as the user's only move — and closing IS the reject path, so the dApp
 * collected a 4001 the user never gave. Any replacement must keep that
 * property: correct verdict AND a way forward.
 *
 * Nothing here parses, scales or compares an AMOUNT (`batchPassKey` only
 * stringifies legs; `displayTokenSymbol` only chooses between a symbol and the
 * empty string), so no money rule is being restated outside a core.
