// Ported from src/services/wallet-state-core/clear-executor.ts @ f9bcb278 — RN seams rewritten to the web modules; logic verbatim.
/**
 * The only place the `clear_signing` core touches the outside world.
 *
 * Five operations, each one existing service call. Nothing here interprets:
 * the five-level decode fallback, the ERC-165 revert-vs-unreachable ruling, the
 * decimals trust rule, the risk floors and the SIWE domain adjudication are all
 * in Rust. This file fetches, calls, waits and reports RAW answers — including
 * the difference between "the RPC answered with an error object" and "the RPC
 * could not be reached", which is exactly the distinction a wrong guess would
 * turn into a permanently mis-cached token standard.
 *
 * Two timeouts, two owners, deliberately:
 * - the descriptor fetch's 5 s stays in the fetch layer (`NET_TIMEOUTS.descriptor`),
 *   because it collapses to the same observable "no descriptor" the core already
 *   models;
 * - the 3 s ERC-165 race and the 4 s decimals warm are core `Timer` operations,
 *   because the core decides what a timeout MEANS (render ERC-20 but cache
 *   nothing; fall back to 18 decimals but flag `unverified`).
 *
 * Failure contract (shared effect loop): nothing rejects. Every rejection is
 * converted into the result variant that operation answers with.

/**
 * In-flight coalescing for the read-only lookups. NOT a cache: an entry exists
 * only while the request it stands for is outstanding, and nothing is retained
 * once it settles, so no answer can go stale here and no retention policy is
 * being invented outside the core.
 *
 * It exists because the N legs of one `wallet_sendCalls` each run on their OWN
 * core session (the machine resolves one request at a time and supersedes
 * anything in flight, so legs cannot share one) and therefore on their own
 * descriptor / ERC-165 / decimals caches. The legs start in the same tick, so
 * two legs touching the same token used to issue two descriptor fetches, two
 * ERC-165 probes and two `decimals()` reads — and, because the core's 3 s
 * ERC-165 race and 4 s decimals warm are real races, could receive DIFFERENT
 * answers and print two rows that disagree about one token. Coalesced, they are
 * handed the same bytes at the same instant and cannot.
 *
 * Answers stay raw. What a revert means, what a timeout means and what may be
 * cached remain the core's rulings. `timer` and `now` are deliberately never
 * coalesced: their answers are per-core (a timer token, a clock reading).
