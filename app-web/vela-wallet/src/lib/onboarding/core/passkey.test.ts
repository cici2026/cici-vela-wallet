/**
 * Which relying party a ceremony runs under (spec 027 D31 / FR-307 / SC-306).
 *
 * The failure this prevents is the quiet one. Under `chrome-extension://` the
 * document's hostname is the extension id, and a ceremony that takes it mints a
 * VALID passkey — nothing throws, nothing warns — for a relying party
 * `https://getvela.app` cannot see. The address is derived from the keys, so
 * the extension silently becomes a second, empty wallet. It was found by
 * installing the extension in real Chrome and reading the dialog: it named the
 * extension id. No test in the suite had an opinion.
 *
 * This runs in the NODE project on purpose. The browser project's page is a
 * real https origin and can never be a `chrome-extension:` one, so it could
 * only ever assert the branch that was already correct; supplying the location
 * is what makes the extension branch testable at all.
