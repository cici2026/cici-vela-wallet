/**
 * The in-page signing requester — the web's stand-in for a dApp (spec 026 D22).
 *
 * The Expo app drives its signing sheet from a real transport: a local relay
 * bridging a test dApp page to the wallet. On the web there is no transport to
 * bridge yet — WalletPair and the remote-inject relay are 027 — so this module
 * IS the requester: it posts requests into the same seam a transport would,
 * and receives the same answers a dApp would.
 *
 * That order is deliberate. The signing sheet must be proven against the real
 * machines BEFORE a transport is attached, or 027 would be debugging UI and
 * transport at once.
 *
 * Dev-gated like the rest of `lib/dev`: reached only through a dynamic import
 * behind the console gate, so no production page carries it.
