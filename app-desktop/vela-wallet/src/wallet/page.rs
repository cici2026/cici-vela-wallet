//! The wallet page entity (spec 015 US2): sidebar + content + closable third
//! column, plus the gallery chrome that exposes every state (FR-004).
//!
//! One entity serves both `VELA_PAGE=wallet` (D1 default, panels open on
//! interaction) and `VELA_PAGE=gallery` (adds the state-switcher strip,
//! component boards and the identicon board).
//!
//! Spec 018 reuses this shell for 通讯录 rather than building a second page:
//! the sidebar, third column, Esc handling and gallery chrome already exist,
//! so contacts is a `Section` switch on the content column (research.md D1).
