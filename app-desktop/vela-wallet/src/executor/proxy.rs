//! The app's one HTTP agent, and how it gets out of the machine.
//!
//! **Everything that talks to the network goes through [`agent`].** Not by
//! convention — there is exactly one place an agent is constructed, and it is
//! this one, so a caller cannot get a client that skipped the proxy by
//! forgetting a line. That mattered less when the registry was the only network
//! consumer and it was true by accident; it stops being an accident here,
//! before feature 020's tunnel client and the bug reporter arrive.
//!
//! Two things go wrong on a desktop that `ureq`'s own proxy handling does not
//! cover, and both of them present identically: every registry call sits until
//! its budget elapses and the flow ends on a timeout sheet blaming the index
//! service, while the person's browser loads the same host fine.
//!
//! ## 1. A SOCKS5 proxy is asked to connect to an address we cannot look up
//!
//! `ureq` maps `socks://` and `socks5://` to [`ProxyProtocol::Socks5`], whose
//! `resolve_target` default is `true` — the target hostname is resolved
//! LOCALLY and only the resulting address is handed to the proxy. That is a
//! fine default for a proxy that exists to change the route. It is exactly
//! wrong for the proxy this application actually meets, which exists because
//! name resolution on the machine does not work: the local lookup is precisely
//! the step that cannot succeed, so the request never even reaches the SOCKS
//! handshake. `curl` spells the working variant `socks5h`, browsers do it by
//! default, and there is no case where this app wants the other one — so a
//! SOCKS5 proxy is switched to resolving at the far end. It also stops the
//! lookup leaking around a proxy that was configured to carry it.
//!
//! Note the environment does not have to name `socks` for this to bite:
//! `ureq` reads `ALL_PROXY` BEFORE `HTTPS_PROXY`, so a session exporting both
//! — which is what every proxy tool's setup snippet emits — gets the SOCKS one.
//!
//! ## 2. A desktop launch has no proxy environment at all
//!
//! `ureq` finds a proxy in `ALL_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` / `HTTP_PROXY`. That is
//! right for a CLI, which is started from a shell that has them, and wrong for
//! a desktop application: `Exec=vela-wallet` in the .desktop file inherits the
//! systemd user environment, and a proxy exported from `~/.bashrc` is not in
//! it. So when the environment says nothing, the desktop's own setting is read
//! — the one the browser obeys.
//!
//! ### Per platform
//!
//! * **Linux** — GNOME's `org.gnome.system.proxy`, through `gsettings`. It is
//!   the setting the GNOME/GTK network stack itself uses, so honouring it makes
//!   this app agree with the rest of the session. Read once per process: the
//!   value cannot change mid-flight in any way worth a subprocess per request.
//! * **Windows** — `ureq`'s own `win-system-proxy` feature reads the WinINET
//!   registry keys inside `Proxy::try_from_env()`. Nothing to do here.
//! * **macOS** — nothing. A system proxy there is installed into the network
//!   stack, so a direct connect already goes through it.
//!
//! What is deliberately NOT handled: `mode = 'auto'` (a PAC URL is a JavaScript
//! program, and running one to reach the key registry is not a trade this app
//! makes) and KDE's `kioslaverc`. Both fall through to no proxy, which is the
//! behaviour before this module existed.
