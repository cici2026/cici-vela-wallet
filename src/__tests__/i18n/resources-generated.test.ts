/**
 * `src/i18n/resources.ts` is GENERATED from the corpus in the Rust crate
 * (spec 004-rust-i18n, FR-010/FR-011). This is the assertion that keeps the
 * generation honest.
 *
 * FR-011 is what makes "zero app changes" true: 1,029 `t()` call sites, 92
 * `useTranslation()` hooks and the typed key union in `i18next.d.ts` all keep
 * working *because* the generated object is deep-equal to the hand-maintained one
 * it replaced. That equality was verified once, at the only moment both files
 * existed. What survives afterwards is this: an INDEPENDENT merge of the corpus,
 * deep-compared against what the generator emitted.
 *
 * Independent matters. A test that re-used the generator's own merge would pass
 * for any generator, including a broken one. This walks the 240 files itself, in
 * the order the generated file declares, and compares the result.
 *
 * It is deliberately immune to legitimate content edits — changing a translation
 * changes both sides — and sensitive to exactly the failure that matters: the
 * generator dropping a namespace, reordering the spread, or losing a locale.
